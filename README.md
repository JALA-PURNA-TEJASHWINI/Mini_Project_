This project addresses a critical communication barrier faced by the hearing-impaired community by introducing a real-time Audio to Sign Language Translator. By integrating speech-to-text APIs with a sign language translation module, the system effectively converts spoken Telugu and English language into visual sign representations. Leveraging Python, NLP, the solution ensures high accuracy, adaptability to noisy environments, and support for multiple languages. This technology not only enhances inclusivity and accessibility but also paves the way for future developments in assistive communication tools. As a result, it holds immense potential for deployment in educational, social, and professional settings, significantly empowering individuals with hearing impairments.
